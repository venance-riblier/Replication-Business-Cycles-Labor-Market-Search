# Replication-Business-Cycles-Labor-Market-Search

In this project, I propose a replication of Andolfatto, D. (1996). Business cycles and labor-market search. _The American Economic Review_, 112-132.

The model is solved by log linearization around the steady state. The resolution of the model, the computation of impulse response functions, the replication of the main tables of the paper and additional analysis are conducted in the same file ``Replication_Andolfatto.m``. The .pdf file presents the results.
